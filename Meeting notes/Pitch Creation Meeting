Key points from Kim: What is the product and why is it useful?

Points for the slide

Train table sanitising robot 
Cleans surfaces
Works while the train is in motion
Saves waiting time
avoids people
Reduces human contact (risk of transmission?) 
Focus on cleaning touchpoints 
510 hours per night spent cleaning carriages [Northern]

Actual pitch:

£100,000+ of cleaning costs
430 staff cleaning trains
6,000 door buttons cleaned multiple times each day
[Norther trains]


We are creating a train sanitising robot which cleans and sanitises train tables 
while the train is moving to save waiting times at stations and reduce risk to 
employees and customers. 

As it stands trains must be stopped for a significant amount of time 
between journeys to properly disinfect, costing money, time and risking cleaners being exposed 
to viral infections. For example Northern trains employs 430 staff to clean the trains each day. 
They carry out 510 hours of cleaning per night costing upwards of £5,000 per night.   

Our robot will clear and disinfect hundreds of empty tables as well as disinfecting thousands of buttons while the train is 
moving and while passengers are on board. This means trains will be able to operate more 
frequently allowing cost and time efficiency while maintaining high standards of hygiene and service.

The robot will intelligently detect whether or not a table is occupied before making the decision to clean or move on.
We also hope to make the robot capable of moving out of the way of passengers as they move along the aisle to
reduce disruption to the public.
