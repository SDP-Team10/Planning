**Milestones & Task decomposition**

**STEP 1** Move along aisle
Stability
Recognize obstacles (end of carriages) using Lidar
Move in straight line
(IR sensors)

**STEP 2**
1. First assume table is free of rubbish >> sanitize
Recognize edge of table (color & shape)
Moving arm
Spray disinfectant
Determine pressure to apply to swipe the table

2. Then clean tables of rubbish
Detects rubbish
Arm moves to sweep rubbish into bag
Arm swipes
End of warm with mop cleans

**STEP 3** Identifying unoccupied tables
Camera or IR sensor to check the entire length of the chair to determine distance to nearest object (compare against length to wall)

**STEP 4** Detect people moving down aisle & move out of the way
Detect any object if still not end of carriage as obstacle needed to avoid
Or use sticker on walls to check end of carriage
Save current position -> Move back to docking station -> Wait 40s -> Move back to position

**STEP 5** Clean door buttons & open buttons
Check for types of buttons & check respective heights to detect circles
For exit buttons that light up: Use camera to **detect** circle shape
Rotate to clean circle
Have 2 functions corresponding to 2 IF statements (detect button/table?)
Exert little more pressure to open buttons (if necessary)

**STEP 6** Cross carriages
Depends on train (research)
Option so far: large & flexible wheels

**STEP 7** Webots presentation
Simulate train environment using Webots to test robot
