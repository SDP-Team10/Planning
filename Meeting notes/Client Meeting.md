  * Stairs are tricky
  * Predefining what to fetch would reduce usefulness
  * Picking up things can be very tricky
  
* Train janitor
  * a new idea for SDP 
  * people could try steal the robot
  * access to CCTV cameras could be useful
  * can be sanitised as the train is on the go
  * cleaning tables could be bases case with expansion to clean seats
  * could have to clear tables (possible addition 
  * would have to avoid people on the move
  
* Medical robot
